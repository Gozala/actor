/**
 * Task is a unit of computation that runs concurrently, a light-weight
 * process (in Erlang terms). You can spawn bunch of them and provided
 * cooperative scheduler will interleave their execution.
 *
 * Tasks have three type variables first two describing result of the
 * computation `Success` that corresponds to return type and `Failure`
 * describing an error type (caused by thrown exceptions). Third type
 * varibale `Message` describes type of messages this task may produce.
 *
 * Please note that that TS does not really check exceptions so `Failure`
 * type can not be guaranteed. Yet, we find them more practical that omitting
 * them as TS does for `Promise` types.
 *
 * Our tasks are generators (not the generator functions, but what you get
 * invoking them) that are executed by (library provided) provided scheduler.
 * Scheduler recognizes two special `Control` instructions yield by generator.
 * When scheduler gets `context` instruction it will resume generator with
 * a handle that can be used to resume running generator after it is suspended.
 * When `suspend` instruction is received scheduler will suspend execution until
 * it is resumed by queueing it from the outside event.

/**
 * Effect represents potentially asynchronous operation that results in a set
 * of events. It is often comprised of multiple `Task` and represents either
 * chain of events or a concurrent set of events (stretched over time).
 * `Effect` campares to a `Stream` the same way as `Task` compares to `Promise`.
 * It is not representation of an eventual result, but rather representation of
 * an operation which if execute will produce certain result. `Effect` can also
 * be compared to an `EventEmitter`, because very often their `Event` type
 * variable is a union of various event types, unlike `EventEmitter`s however
 * `Effect`s have inherent finality to them an in that regard they are more like
 * `Stream`s.
 *
 * You may notice that `Effect`, is just a `Task` which never fails, nor has a
 * (meaningful) result. Instead it can produce events (send messages).
